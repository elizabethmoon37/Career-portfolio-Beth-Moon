      So, let's start with a wee explanation as to how this website came
      together. Every year, I try to further my Product or Tech education - to
      make sure I stay relevant in both worlds, and to constantly challenge
      myself. In 2023, I decided to tackle something I have always felt insecure
      about when working with talented developers, something I thought I would
      never fully understand -
      <strong>how to code.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="text-center mt-5 mb-8 p-3">
      Now, don't get me wrong - it hasn't been easy. I have been working full
      time with the Scottish Government as a Product Lead as I take this course
      with
      <a
        href="https://www.shecodes.io/"
        class="SheCodes-link"
        title="SheCodes website"
        target="_blank"
        >SheCodes.</a
      >
      It takes about three evenings a week, after a full day of work, to stay on
      track with the course deadlines. The workshops are well structured but
      rely on self-motivation to keep going, which can be tough when all you
      want to do is curl up on the couch after a long working day! But after
      completing my Certified Scrum Product Owner qualification in 2021, and
      then my Prince 2 Foundation and Practicioner qualifications in 2022, I
      knew the time had come and I was determined to take as much as I could
      from the course.

    <p class="text-center mt-5 mb-8 p-3">
      So, without further ado, please explore this multi-page, glorious example
      of how much I have learnt so far in terms of writing code. It is 100% manually coded without any help from an AI source; in fact I wrote a grand total of 975 lines of code to create it. You'll find out
      about life before my career switch, the projects I have created along the
      way, and what is yet to come. I hope you enjoy! ðŸŽ‰

              Unsure of what I wanted to do with my career, I decided to do the
              oddest degree known to man in the National University of Galway,
              Ireland - I graduated in 2014 with an international First Class
              Honours degree in History, Italian, and Children Studies. The
              minute my exams were over, I ran away to India to spend the summer
              there working and travelling. I returned to Ireland, received my
              Grade A CELTA teaching qualification and moved to Sicily.

              I spent the next six years teaching around the world. In 2017, I
              moved to Edinburgh which has been my home ever since. I worked in
              multiple private language schools and spent my summers working as
              an English Fellow for the University of Edinburgh. By 2019, I felt
              like I had taken my teaching career as far as I possibly could. It
              was time for a change, so I left the Education sector in December
              2019. Great timing for a career change!

              After a stressful, unemployed introduction to a global pandemic, I
              finally secured a role on a new career path. I was hired as a
              Junior Product Owner for a startup branch of Virgin Trains Tech. I
              was initially ill-equipped to work from home (see photo of my
              smart ironing board desk!) and was trying to come to terms with
              the worlds of Tech, Product and Rail all at once. BUT... I adored
              it. All of it, I had definitely caught the Product bug. And I
              haven't looked back since!
